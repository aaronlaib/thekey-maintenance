      We are scheduling a maintenance window for The Key on Tuesday February 8th
      from 10:00pm - 11:00pm (3:00am - 4:00am UTC Wednesday) to perform a
      required database upgrade. During this window we are expecting 30 minutes
      of downtime that will prevent users from authenticating with The Key. This
      maintenance window will have no effect on applications that no longer use
      The Key and now use Okta directly for authentication.
